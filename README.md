# Portfolio_100daysofPython
This is my portfolio of learning Python from the scratch with the #100daysofPython challenge.

# Day 1
- Learned about Funcions and Variables
- Created my first ever program: Band Name Generator
~ Brief examples:
• How to multiply the string it down the line with: \n
print("Hello World!\nHello World!\nHello World!\nHello World!")
• Adding different string lines together
print("Hello," +" Orkhan!")
• Input Functions (It's for user to put some kind of data) for example: Hello and input would be your name, computer first require input and than put it together.
print("Hello, " + input("What is your name?"))
• How to find number of characters in user'Name with len() function
print(len(input("What is your name?")))
• giving names to variables like: name = input("What is your name?")
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(name)

# Day 2
- Learned about data types (integer, float, boolean) and how to use them.
- Learned how to apply mathematical operations into the program
- Created programs which use simple math like: "Tip calculator," "BMI calculator," "Life in weeks"
Brief examples:
• Pulling out individual characters from the string with []
print("Hello"[0])
• in normal life, we use commas to interpret large numbers like 123,456,758 in python we can use _ like 123_456_758
• Float - We use this when we have decimals in number.
• Boolean - when it has only two possible values: True or false
• This is how we can check with what kind of data we are working with: type()
a = str(123)
print(type(a))
• if we want to round a number: round()
for example round(8 / 3, 2) ,2 is how many decimal places you want
• manipulate a value based on previous Value. for example: score = 0; and if score becomes +1, we dont have to write score = score +1; 
we can just simply use score += 1
• f-string - to mix different kind of data types
